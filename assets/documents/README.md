## 📊 ATS (Applicant Tracking System) Tips

Many companies use ATS to screen resumes. Make yours ATS-friendly:

1. **Use standard section headings**:
   - "Work Experience" not "Where I've Worked"
   - "Education" not "Academic Journey"

2. **Include keywords** from job descriptions

3. **Avoid:**
   - Tables and columns (can confuse ATS)
   - Headers and footers
   - Images and graphics
   - Unusual fonts

4. **Use standard file format**: PDF (unless DOC is specifically requested)
